        <h1>Best cafes in Indirapuram</h1>
        <p>
          If you are a foodie, then you would have surely noticed the change
          that’s been happening in our lovely city. As Indirapuram is
          urbanising, a bunch of cafes have been popping up all over the city.
          Now, not all of them are good, so you shouldn’t just go to the first
          one that pops up when you google “cafe Indirapuram”! To make your job
          easier, we have compiled a list of the best Indirapuram cafes. Here
          you go:
        </p>

        <h2>Cafe 99</h2>

        <p>
          Cafe 99 is definitely a foodie’s delight. The team at
          BestinIndirapuram had a blast while testing out this café. The
          ambience, which is one of our (and we’re sure yours also) most
          important factors when rating a café, is simply next-level. The
          non-veg food is out of this world, and surely has our seal of
          approval. The staff is polite, the waiting time is at par with other
          cafes, if not better; there really is not a reason for you to not try
          out this café. Given the vast number of cafes we went to for this
          list, we have no doubts when saying that Cafe 99 is one of the best
          Indirapuram cafes. Here’s all the information you need: <br />

        <img src="../assets/timeout.jpg" alt="Time Out Cafe, Indirapuram" />
        <p>
          It's not every day that you stumble into a café, and know right away,
          that this is a place you would be visiting more than once. Time Out
          Cafe is that place. The staff’s particularly delightful and polite,
          and they were more than happy to answer our queries. The décor's
          minimalistic, yet immensely powerful. And to say that the food is
          tasty would be an understatement. But in the end, what makes this café
          unique among other Indirapuram cafes, is the definite, distinctive,
          “vibe”. It can’t be really summed in words, no matter how hard we try
          (and we’re trying). Want to visit right away? Here’s how you can go
          about doing that: <br />
